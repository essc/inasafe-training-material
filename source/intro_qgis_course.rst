=========================

This course introduces participants to Free and Open Source Geospatial tools.  
We will explore Quantum GIS as an easy to use FOSS-Geo application. The 
materials focus on the basic interface and data exploration of QGIS.

QGIS (`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`_) is a user friendly Open Source 
Geographic Information System (GIS) that runs on several operating systems 
(Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, and Windows). QGIS supports vector, raster, and database 
formats. QGIS is licensed under the GNU Public License.
