InaSAFE is a plugin for QGIS. It aims to produce realistic natural
hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response
activities, using hazard and exposure geographic data.  

Concept
-----------

To effectively prepare for future floods, earthquakes or tsunami you must first 
understand the likely impacts that need to be managed. For example, to prepare 
contingency plans for a severe flood, emergency managers need to 
answer questions like:

* what are the areas likely to be affected;
* how many people will need to be evacuated and sheltered;
* which schools will be closed;
* which hospitals can still take patients; and
* what roads will be closed?

How does it work?
---------------------

InaSAFE provides a simple but rigorous way to combine data from scientists, 
local governments and communities to provide insights into the likely impacts 
of future disaster events. The software is focused on examining, in detail, 
the impacts by a single hazard would have on specific sectors.
