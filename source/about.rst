About this document
=====================

This document was designed as a supplementary material for the 
"QGIS and InaSAFE Workshop" under the "**Participatory mapping 
and LGU decision support tools for Disaster Risk Reduction**"
in partnership with the Department of Interior and Local Government, 
World Bank-East Asia Pacific and East Asia-AusAid Infrastructure for 
Growth program, OpenStreetMap-Philippines  and the municipalities of 
of Candaba, Guagua, and Lubao, all in the province of Pampanga.

About the Project
-----------------------------------------

The project will provide training on participatory mapping and InaSAFE support to the 
Philippine government in disaster risk reduction activities through these strategies:

* Supporting the growth of the OpenStreetMap community that has competence in leveraging 
  participatory mapping methods with OpenStreetMap tools and Web-based map platforms and 
  is a proven effective approach to community engagement and in obtaining data
* Supporting the customization of InaSAFE that will leverage the InaSAFE initiative 
  with the decision support tool component of the project, having been developed and 
  implemented in Indonesia so far. The Department of Interior and Local Government 
  identified InaSAFE’s potential in assisting local governments design their contingency 
  and land use plans.

At the end of the workshop, the participants should be able to: 

* Understand the basic principles of how QGIS 2.0 works; 
* Learn how to edit their existing dataset using QGIS;
* Understand the basic functionality of InaSAFE;
* Formulate a better land use and disaster risk reduction and management plans through 
  the help of InaSAFE impact function results that may be later implemented in their 
  respective municipality.
